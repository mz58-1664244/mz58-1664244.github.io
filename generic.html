					<p>Traveling itself has no meaning, other than the one you give to it, just like life. I used to work in a hotel virtually across the street from the Louvre Museum in Paris. Many of the foreigners staying at the hotel asked for recommendations regarding what to do or see before leaving the hotel in the morning. When confronted with a huge array of possibilities, they often decided to go to most places mentioned in a day or two. These places ranged from world-class museums to architectural wonders or dining experiences. The only possible explanation for such behavior is that they went to all those places just to be able to say they were there.</p>

					<p>When more reasonable guests came back from their day in Paris, having visited maybe one museum, a restaurant, and a beautiful building, their lives had changed, and in a completely different way for each one of them. They had gotten something out of it, and they even seemed to be brainstorming about future plans as a result of it.</p>

					<p> Sometimes work puts so much stress and tension on me that I can hardly breathe. It is like you know you gonna lose it, and that you gradually turn into a bad friend and a horrible daughter. Sometimes you just got bored by the city vibe, desperately in need of a refresh. It is like there is a button which starts the daily rountie - laundary, cleaning, picking up kids etc. Once you press the button it won't go off until you press again. And travelling is to press that 'pause' button and escape. Go to a different city, meet nice/instant friends, embrace a foreign culture, and most importantly loosen up. Taking a nice journey gives you a fresh start, after which you become a greater friends/colleague!</p>
